# Welcome

This page contains a tiny inline Rust playground.

Try it. Edit the code and press Run.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("hello from your mini playground");
}
```

Code without `main` will be wrapped automatically when run.

```rust,editable
pub fn double(x: i32) -> i32 { x * 2 }
```
